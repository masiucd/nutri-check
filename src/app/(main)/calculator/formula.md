To calculate your daily calorie intake based on age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and weight goals, you can follow these steps:

## Step 1: Calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

BMR represents the number of calories your body needs at rest to maintain basic physiological functions. The formulas for calculating BMR are:

- **For Men**:

  $$
  BMR = 66.47 + (13.75 \times \text{weight in kg}) + (5.003 \times \text{height in cm}) - (6.755 \times \text{age in years})
  $$

- **For Women**:
  $$
  BMR = 655.1 + (9.563 \times \text{weight in kg}) + (1.850 \times \text{height in cm}) - (4.676 \times \text{age in years})
  $$

## Step 2: Adjust for Activity Level

Once you have your BMR, multiply it by an activity factor to estimate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):

- **Sedentary (little or no exercise)**: BMR × 1.2
- **Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week)**: BMR × 1.375
- **Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week)**: BMR × 1.55
- **Active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week)**: BMR × 1.725
- **Very active (very hard exercise/physical job & exercise 2x/day)**: BMR × 1.9

## Step 3: Set Your Weight Goal

Depending on your weight goals, you can adjust your TDEE:

- **To lose weight**: Subtract 500-1000 calories from your TDEE for a weight loss of about 1-2 pounds per week.
- **To gain weight**: Add 250-500 calories to your TDEE for a weight gain of about 0.5-1 pound per week.
- **To maintain weight**: Use your TDEE as your daily calorie goal.

## Example Calculation

For a 30-year-old male weighing 70 kg and 175 cm tall, who is moderately active:

1. Calculate BMR:

   $$
   BMR = 66.47 + (13.75 \times 70) + (5.003 \times 175) - (6.755 \times 30) \approx 1,700 \text{ calories}
   $$

2. Adjust for activity level (Moderately active):

   $$
   TDEE = 1,700 \times 1.55 \approx 2,635 \text{ calories}
   $$

3. Set weight goal (e.g., to lose weight):
   $$
   Daily intake = 2,635 - 500 \approx 2,135 \text{ calories}
   $$

This method provides a structured approach to determining your daily caloric needs based on individual factors and goals[1][2][3][4][6][7][8].
